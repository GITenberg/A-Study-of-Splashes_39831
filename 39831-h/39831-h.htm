<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This publication is an attempt to present in a form acceptable to the
general reader the outcome of an inquiry conducted by the aid of
instantaneous photography, which was begun about fourteen years ago. The
author, in 1894, had occasion to lecture at the Royal Institution on the
"Splash of a Drop," of which he had already made a somewhat prolonged
study. That lecture, which was subsequently reprinted in the "Romance of
Science" series by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, dealt
largely with the splash of a drop falling on a solid plate, with which
the present volume is not concerned. At the close of the lecture were
exhibited for the first time a few photographs of some of the phenomena
now dealt with, which the author had just succeeded in taking with the
help of his friend Mr. R. S. Cole. The success of the photographs and
the additional information they afforded led to a long photographic
investigation, which formed the subject of two papers<a
name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1"
class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Royal
Society. Except for two magazine articles,<a name="FNanchor_B_2"
id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
the results of this work have not been presented to the general public.
Moreover, in the illustrations printed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[pg x]</a></span>
Royal Society much of the beauty of the original photographs was lost in
the reproduction, or was sacrificed in a selection of which the only
object was the elucidation of points of technical scientific
interest.</p>

<p>If the present volume is so fortunate as to find
many readers among the general public, as the author
hopes it may, especially among the young whose eyes
are still quick to observe, and whose minds are eager,
it will be on account of admiration for the exquisite
beauty of some of the forms assumed, of surprise at
the revelation of so much where so little was expected,
and because of the peculiar fascination that is always
felt in following any gradually changing natural
phenomenon, in which the sequence of events can,
partly at any rate, be anticipated and understood.</p>

<p>For the sake of serious students of Physics who
may be interested in unexpected phenomena of fluid
motion, all references that seem necessary have been
given in footnotes, and it may be mentioned that the
later photographs of Series I and those of Series I<sub><i>a</i></sub>
and III, have not been previously published, and
afford new information on certain points.</p>

<p>In taking these photographs the author has been
much helped by his friends Dr. G. B. Bryan and
Mr. G. F. Page.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY&mdash;METHODS OF OBSERVATION
AND APPARATUS</h3>


<p>There will be but few of my readers who have
not, in some heavy shower of rain, beguiled
the tedium of enforced waiting by watching, perhaps
half-unconsciously, the thousand little crystal fountains
that start up from the surface of pool or river; noting
now and then a surrounding coronet of lesser jets, or
here and there a bubble that floats for a moment and
then vanishes.</p>

<p>It is to this apparently insignificant transaction,
which always has been and always will be so familiar,
and to others of a like nature, that I desire to call the
attention of those who are interested in natural phenomena;
hoping to share with them some of the
delight that I have myself felt, in contemplating the
exquisite forms that the camera has revealed, and in
watching the progress of a multitude of events, compressed
indeed within the limits of a few hundredths
of a second, but none the less orderly and inevitable,
and of which the sequence is in part easy to anticipate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[pg 2]</a></span>
and understand, while in part it taxes the highest
mathematical powers to elucidate.</p>

<p>In these modern days of kinematographs and snapshot
cameras it might seem an easy matter to follow,
by the aid of photography, even a splashing drop.
But in reality the task is not so simple, for the changes
of form that take place in a splash are far too rapid to
come within reach of any ordinary kinematograph,
and even the quickest photographic shutter is also
much too slow, so that it is necessary to have recourse
to the far shorter exposure of a suitable electric spark.
The originals of the photographs which illustrate this
book were taken by means of a spark, whose duration
was certainly less than three-millionths of a second,
an interval of time which bears to a whole second
about the same proportion as a day to a thousand
years.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the photographs, advantage was
taken of the fact that whatever be the sequence
of events in any particular splash, this sequence will
be exactly repeated every time that a falling drop
strikes the surface under exactly the same conditions,
and the problem to be solved was, therefore, as
follows:&mdash;To cause a drop of definite size to fall
from a definite height in absolute darkness so as
to strike the surface of the liquid into which it falls
at a spot towards which is directed a photographic
camera with uncovered lens, and armed with an
exceptionally sensitive plate, and to illuminate the
drop at the instant that it just touches the surface
by a flash of such excessively short duration that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[pg 3]</a></span>
appreciable change of form can take place while the
drop is illuminated.</p>

<p>This gives us a photograph of the earliest stage.
The plate must then be removed and a fresh one
substituted; a second drop, of exactly the same size,
must be let fall from exactly the same place, and
photographed in just the same way, but the flash must
now be so timed as to take place at a slightly later
stage of the splash, say, one-thousandth of a second
later. The photographic plate must be then again
removed and a third substituted, on which a still later
stage is to be depicted, and in this way the phenomenon
can be followed step by step.</p>

<p>By adopting this process, and not attempting to
follow the same individual splash throughout, we avoid
two great difficulties: (1) the necessity of shifting our
photographic plate or film through a distance equal to
the breadth of the whole picture every five hundredth
or thousandth of a second (if we wish to obtain
pictures of stages so near together as this); and (2)
the difficulty of obtaining brilliant flashes of light of
sufficiently short duration at these very short intervals.</p>

<p>For these we substitute two other difficulties: (1)
that of delivering the drops exactly as required; and
(2) that of timing the flash on each occasion within
one or two thousandths of a second, so as to pick out
the exact stage we wish to photograph.</p>

<p>I will now describe how these two problems have
been solved.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to arrange for the production of
small drops of almost exactly equal size. They may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[pg 4]</a></span>
be allowed to fall one by one at a steady rate from the
end of a fine glass tube connected to a vessel in which
the liquid is maintained at a constant level, as in
Fig. 1, or they may be squeezed out slowly as required
by means of a syringe held in a clip as in Fig. 2.
Any required number of these small drops can be
caught, and allowed to run together if a larger drop is
to be experimented with.</p>

<p>If the liquid used is mercury, the drops may be
caught in any little glass cup such as a deeply concave
watch-glass; but other liquids, such as water or milk,
would wet the glass and stick to it.</p>

<p>If, however, the inside surface of the watch-glass be
first carefully smoked in the flame of a candle, then
even water or milk will roll over it without sticking,
and the drop thus made up will retain a spheroidal
form, and can be conveyed to the place of observation
in the dark room, where it is transferred to the
"dropping cup."</p>

<p>This consists of a similar, deep, smoked watch-glass
(W)&mdash;see <a href="#Page_7">Plate I</a>&mdash;supported on the end of
a small horizontal lever, a light cylindrical rod of
about the dimensions of an ordinary uncut lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[pg 5]</a></span>
pencil, pivoted about a horizontal axle near the end
to which the watch-glass is attached. The other end
is armed with a small light piece of iron (I) and is
held in position by means of an electro-magnet (M),
against the action of a spring. On cutting off the
current from the electro-magnet the spring, acting as a
catapult, tosses up the longer arm of the lever and thus
removes the watch-glass from below the drop (D),
which is left unsupported in mid-air, so that it falls
from a definite fixed distance into a bowl of water
placed below it, towards the surface of which the
camera (C) is directed. This solves problem number
one. Of course, if we wish to observe the splash of
a solid sphere, there is no need to smoke the surface
of the watch-glass. Indeed, the sphere may be more
conveniently supported on a small ring.</p>

<p>Now for the production and timing of the flash. Two
large Leyden jars (JJ) are provided, and charged by
an electrical machine on their inner coats, one positively
and one negatively. Stout wires lead from the outer
coats to the dark room, and terminate in a spark-gap
(S) between magnesium terminals close over the surface
of the water in the bowl just mentioned. If the
inner coats are now connected together, the positive
and negative charges unite with a dazzling flash and a
simultaneous discharge and flash takes place between
the two outer coats across the spark-gap in the dark
room.</p>

<p>This latter is the illuminating spark; we have now
to time it correctly.</p>

<p>For this purpose it is arranged that the discharge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[pg 6]</a></span>
shall be effected by means of a falling metal sphere (T)
which I shall call the timing sphere, which passes between
two terminals S and S connected one to the inside
of one jar and one to the inside of the other. These
terminals are just too far apart for a spark to leap
across, till the timing sphere passes between them and
thus shortens the gap; then the discharge takes place,
with its accompanying flash in the dark room.</p>

<p>The release of the timing sphere is effected by an
arrangement of lever and spring controlled by an
electro-magnet exactly similar to that which releases
the drop in the dark room, and the two electro-magnets
<i>are on the same electric circuit</i>, so that the drop and
timing sphere <i>are released simultaneously</i>. But while
the drop always falls the same distance, the height
through which the timing sphere has to fall before
producing discharge can be adjusted at will, and to
great nicety, by moving its releasing-lever up or down
a vertical support with a scale attached.</p>

<p>If, for example, a particular stage of the splash is
photographed when the timing sphere falls just four
feet to the gap, then by raising its releasing-lever about
two-fifths of an inch, the laws of falling bodies tell us
that we shall postpone the flash by just one-thousandth
of a second, and the next photograph will accordingly
reveal a stage just so much later.</p>

</table>

<p>It ought still to be mentioned that to make the
utmost use of the illuminating power of the spark, it
is necessary to place close behind it a little concave
mirror (R), by means of which a compact beam of rays,
which would otherwise have been wasted, is directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[pg 9]</a></span>
to the required spot. By this addition we imitate, in
miniature, the search-light of a man-of-war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As with all experimental devices, the precision
attainable with this arrangement is limited by several
circumstances. In the first place, the demagnetization
of the iron cores of the electro-magnets, when the
current is cut off, is not truly instantaneous, and the
time required depends on the strength of the magnetizing
current and on the temperature of the iron, which
in turn will depend on the length of time for which
the current has been running. This variation would
be of no importance if the two magnets were exactly
alike and the springs of exactly equal strength, conditions
which can be nearly but not perfectly fulfilled.</p>

<p>A more important source of uncertainty arises from
the fact that the time at which the spark takes place
depends partly on the magnitude of the + and -&nbsp;
charges which have been allowed to accumulate on the
discharging knobs connected to the two Leyden jars,
for when these charges are larger, then the spark will
be longer and will take place earlier and before the
timing sphere has reached the mid-position. The
charging has therefore to be carefully watched by
means of the indications of a suitable electrometer,
and the timing sphere must on each occasion be
released when the charges have just reached the right
value. But even this does not entirely suffice, for the
passage of the spark depends also partly on the state
of the surface of the knobs, which cannot be kept at
any high degree of polish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[pg 10]</a></span>
Still, when care is taken to keep the conditions as
nearly as possible constant, neither of these sources of
error is serious, and the reader can judge for himself
of the accuracy of the timing from the photographs
given on Plate II, in which a solid sphere was let fall
in the dark room past a metre scale. The timing sphere
was arranged, in the first four photographs, to illuminate
it at the same stage in its fall, after a descent
of thirty centimetres; if the timing had been perfect
the sphere would appear on each occasion at the same
mark on the scale.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the first, second, and
fourth photographs the falling sphere is almost
accurately bisected by the long line of the three-inch
mark on the right-hand edge of the scale. The
greatest difference of position being just about one
millimetre (as read off the left-hand scale), which
would correspond to an error of about 1/2700 of a
second. But the third photograph is earlier, showing
the sphere 4&middot;5 millimetres higher up, a distance which
implies an error of just 1/600 of a second.</p>

<p>A fifth photograph was then taken, with the timing
arranged so as to illuminate the sphere one centimetre
higher up, and it will be seen that if we compare this
with No. 3, the error is again only one millimetre.
Thus Nos. 3 and 5 agree very closely, but disagree
with Nos. 1, 2, and 4 by about 1/600 of a second.</p>

<p>The photographs themselves supply the reason.
For there happens to be visible on each an (out-of-focus)
image of the spark, and this image is very much
the same in 1, <span class="ins">2</span> and 4, but much larger and brighter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[pg 11]</a></span>
in 3 and 5, showing that the knobs were then more
highly charged, which would account for the spark
occurring a little too early.</p>

<p>But when we are watching the splash made by the
fall of a liquid drop, instead of a solid sphere, there is
a new and more serious source of difficulty. For the
drop as it lies on the smoked glass cup is not perfectly
spherical, but is flattened by its own weight, as shown
in Fig. 3, and on the sudden removal of the supporting
cup it oscillates between an oval form,
elongated vertically, and a flattened form (see
Fig. 4). These oscillations are unavoidable, and
their extent will depend partly on the amount of
adhesion between the smoked surface and the drop,
and as this adhesion is never entirely absent and is
variable, depending partly on the length of time that
the drop has been lying in the cup, it follows that the
drop will always receive a slight tug downwards at
starting, which will be greater on some occasions than
on others. On this account not only will the time
taken to reach the water vary slightly, but the drop
will strike it sometimes when elongated and sometimes
when flattened, and the resulting splash will be
affected by this circumstance.</p>

<p>With higher falls the timing sphere is moving
more quickly past the discharging knobs, and the
error due to a longer or shorter spark is correspondingly
less, so that it appears safe to say that the
accuracy of the timing was such that, when all precautions
were taken, any desired stage could be picked
out within two-thousandths of a second.</p>

<p>It is not however pretended that the precautions
necessary for the most accurate timing were always
taken, especially in the earlier Series of Photographs,
for the main object of the experiments was to find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[pg 13]</a></span>
what happened, and only incidentally to ascertain
exactly how long it took to happen, and there is no
doubt that on some occasions, through the smoke-film
being allowed to wear away, adhesions to the dropping
cup occurred, with a corresponding disturbance of the
timing, before the defect was noticed and remedied.</p>

</div>

<p>It remains to mention, for the sake of those interested in photography,
that notwithstanding the sensitiveness of the plates and the brilliance
of the illuminating spark, its duration was so short that the negatives
were always "under-exposed."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> I have
mentioned that the effective duration of the spark was less than
three-millionths of a second. The evidence for this is the accompanying
photograph (Fig. 5), taken of a cardboard disc when rotating at a rate
of fifty-three turns per second; the disc was 22
cm. in diameter, and had been roughly graduated
round the edge with pen and ink. The photograph
of the part that was in focus shows no perceptible
blurring of the edge of the marks, and with a lens, a
blurring of one-tenth of a millimetre would be easily
detectable. Since the edge was moving at a rate of
36&middot;5 metres per second (about 78 miles per hour), the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[pg 14]</a></span>
time taken to traverse one-tenth of a millimetre would
be rather less than three-millionths of a second. Hence
we may conclude that the illumination did not last so
long as this.</p>

<p>The weakness of the negatives was met by a
prolonged development of about forty minutes in a
saturated solution of eikonogen. This forbade the
use of any artificial light, and all the photographic
processes had to be conducted in absolute darkness.
To avoid the tedium of long waiting in the dark
room, a light-tight tray was constructed, in which
several developing dishes could be placed, and the
whole brought out into the daylight and suitably
rocked. In this way ten or twelve photographs could
be developed simultaneously.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to mention here that the
bright spark given by breaking the <i>primary</i> circuit of
an induction coil at the surface of mercury was found
to be of much too long duration to be useful for the
purposes of splash-photography.</p>

<h3>THE SPLASH OF A DROP&mdash;LOW FALL</h3>


<p>We will now turn to the photographic record
itself. The first series shows the splash of a
drop of water weighing &middot;2 of a gram, and therefore 7&middot;36
millimetres (or rather less than one-third of an inch) in
diameter, falling 40 cm. (about 16 inches) into milk
mixed with water. The object of adding milk to the
water was to make it more visible. The addition of
milk makes, as we shall see, a little but not much
difference in the general character of the splash.
The scale of the figures is three-quarters of the
actual size.</p>

<p>The number written against any figure gives, on
the assumption that no unobserved error has crept in,
the time in decimal parts of a second that has elapsed
since the stage marked "<i>T = 0</i>," which is nearest to
the first instant of contact. The reader will understand
from what has been said that the error in any
of these times may be as much as two-thousandths of
a second, but is not likely to be more than that, when
all precautions were taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[pg 16]</a></span>
It will be observed that as the drop descends into
the liquid the upper portion is at first not appreciably
distorted, but that a little cup or crater of liquid is
thrown up round it. As the drop descends further,
this crater grows wider and higher and thicker in the
wall, and jets are shot out from its edge or rim. These
jets are visible even in the second figure. The black
marks on the inside wall of the crater are due to the
lamp-black carried down with the drop from the
smoked surface of the supporting cup: though in
one sense a disfigurement, they serve to show by their
presence that the interior of the crater <i>is lined by the
original liquid which formed the drop</i>, and thus afford
useful information as to the nature of the flow.</p>

<p>The crater rises with great rapidity up to Fig. 4.
In Fig. 5 the walls are beginning to grow thicker,
while the next three figures show the crater subsiding
and widening, till in Fig. 9 it lies as a mere ring of
lobes on the surface, surrounding a central hollow.</p>

Fig. 10 shows the beginning of the rebound, in the
rising of a central column. It will be seen that the
lamp-black is now all swept to the middle, indicating
that <i>the liquid of the original drop emerges at the head</i>
of the central column. Full confirmation of this is
obtained from Fig. 12, which represents the emergent
column obtained when the circumstances are all the
same, except that we have a drop of milk falling into
water instead of water falling into milk. It will
be observed that the upper part only of the column
is visible, precisely because it contains nearly all the
milk of the drop, while the lower part, consisting
chiefly of transparent water, remains invisible.</p>

If, however, the summit of the primary column
succeeds in breaking off (as in Fig. 18<sub><i>b</i></sub>), or even in
very nearly breaking off, then the impact of this
newly-formed drop forms a second slight crater on
the top of the first cake, and we have the series
(18<sub><i>b</i></sub> to 24<sub><i>b</i></sub>), in which it will be observed that the
rim of the secondary crater spreads rapidly outwards,
so that a second well-marked circular ripple
in this case <i>quickly</i> follows the first. The secondary
column that is thrown up in Fig. 23<sub><i>b</i></sub> is very like that
which emerged at a much earlier stage in the (<i>a</i>)
series.</p>

<p>The photographs of this (<i>b</i>) series show very
beautifully the manner in which the advancing edge
of the ripple degenerates into smaller ripples travelling
with greater speed.</p>

It will be readily understood that if the splitting off
of the head of the primary column happens to take
place a little earlier, or on the other hand is nearly,
but not quite, complete when it descends below the
surface, then subsequent configurations will differ
somewhat from either of the sub-series here shown.</p>

<p>Since any figure photographed might belong to
either sequence, the disentanglement of the two series
required careful consideration and long experimenting.</p>

<p>The reappearance of the original drop at the head
of the rebounding column, of which the explanation
has been given in this chapter, is easily verified by
naked-eye observation.</p>

<p>Let the reader when he next receives a cup of tea
or coffee to which no milk has yet been added, make
the simple experiment of dropping into it from a spoon,
at the height of fifteen or sixteen inches above the
surface, a single drop of milk. He will have no
difficulty in recognizing that the column which
emerges carries the white milk-drop at the top only
slightly stained by the liquid into which it has
fallen.</p>

<p>In the same way naked-eye observation reveals the
crater thrown up by the entry of a big rain-drop into
a pool of water. In either case what we are able
to glimpse is a "stationary" stage. The rebounding
column reaches a maximum height, remains poised
for an instant, and then descends. The same is true
of the crater. It is the relatively long duration of the
moment of poise that produces on the eye a clear
impression where all else is blurred by rapid change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[pg 31]</a></span>
But there is frequently a curious illusion. We often
seem to see the crater with the column standing erect
in the middle of it. We know now that in reality the
crater has vanished before the column appears. But
the image of the crater has not time to fade before
that of the column is superposed on it.</p>

<p>Those who are accustomed "to believe nothing
that they hear and only half of what they see" may
be glad to find at least the latter part of their maxim
so completely justified.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLES INVOLVED</h3>


<p>The reader's attention has now been directed to
various features which, with certain modifications,
will be found in many of the splashes that we shall
examine; but so far the language used has been simply
descriptive and in no way explanatory. Instead of
going on to describe other splashes in the same way,
and thus to accumulate a great mass of unco&ouml;rdinated
descriptive detail, it will be better to pause for a
moment in order to become acquainted with certain
principles connected with the behaviour of liquids, the
application of which will go a long way towards explaining
what we see going on in any splash.</p>

<p>The first principle to be understood is that the
surface layers of any liquid behave like a uniformly
stretched skin or membrane, which is always endeavouring
to contract and to diminish its area. If
the surface is flat, like the surface of still liquid in a
bowl, this surface-tension has only the effect of exerting
a small inward pull on the walls of the bowl. But
if the surface is curved, with a convexity outwards,
then the surface layers, on account of their tension,
press the interior liquid back, and thus tend to check
the growth of any protuberance; while, on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[pg 33]</a></span>
hand, if the surface is concave outwards, then the
surface-tension tends to pull the interior liquid forward,
and so to diminish the concavity.</p>

<p>Direct evidence of this surface-tension is easy to
cite. We have it in any pendent drop, such as any
of those shown in the accompanying figures.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="position: relative; width: 500px;">
  <p class="center">WATER.</p>
    <img src="images/fig-p033-water.png"

    width="400" height="54" alt="" title="" />
  <p class="center">Pendent drops (magnified 2-1/4 times).</p>
</div>

<p>If we ask ourselves how it is that the liquid
in the interior of one of these drops does not flow out,
pressed as it is by the liquid above it, the answer is
that everywhere the stretched skin presses it back.
A soap-bubble too presses on the air in its interior,
both the outside layers and the inside layers of the thin
film being curved over the interior space. This is the
reason that a soap-bubble blown on the bowl of a pipe
will slowly collapse again if we remove the stem
of the pipe from our mouth. The bubble drives the
interior air back through the pipe. And it is easy to
show that if two soap-bubbles be blown on the ends
of two tubes which can be connected together by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[pg 34]</a></span>
opening a tap between them, then the smaller will
collapse and blow out the larger. The reason of this
is that in the bubble of smaller radius the surface
layers are more sharply curved, and therefore exert
a greater pressure on the air within. Thus if a strap
be pulled at each end with a total tension T and bent
over a solid cylinder of small radius, as in Fig. 6, it is
easy to see that the pressure on the surface of the part
of the cylinder touched by the strap is less than if the
strap be bent over an equal area on a cylinder of larger
radius (Fig. 7). The tension of the surface layers
of a liquid causes them to act on the liquid within,
exactly as does the stretched strap on the solid in
these figures. If at any place the liquid presents, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[pg 35]</a></span>
it generally does, not a cylindrical surface, but one
with curvature in two directions, then the pressure
corresponds to what would be produced by two straps
crossing at right angles, laid one over the other, each
with the curvature of the surface in its direction
(Fig. 8).</p>

<p>We can now understand why the drop that has been
lying on the watch-glass should oscillate in its descent.
The sharp curvature of the edge AA of the drop (see
Fig. 9) tells us that the liquid there is pushed back by
the pressure of the stretched surface layers, and when
the supporting glass is removed the sides of the drop
move inwards, driving the liquid into the lower part,
the tendency being to make the drop spherical, and so
to equalize the pressure of the surface at all points.
But in the process the liquid overshoots the mark,
and the drop becomes elongated vertically and flattened
at the sides. This causes the curvature at
top and bottom to be sharper than at the sides, and
on this account the back-pressure of the ends soon
checks the elongation and finally reverses the flow
of liquid, and the drop flattens again. As an example
of the way in which a <i>concavity</i> of the surface
is pulled out by the surface-tension may be cited
the dimples made by the weight of an aquatic insect,
where its feet rest on the surface without penetrating
it.</p>

<p>This same surface-tension checks the rise of the
crater, and would cause it to subside again even without
the action of gravity. Thus the pressures of the
sharply curved crater-edge on the liquid between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[pg 36]</a></span>
crater walls are indicated by the dotted arrows in
Fig. 10, and arise from the surface-tension indicated
by the full arrows. During the
early part of the splash the surface-tension
is more important than
gravity in checking the rise of the
walls. For, as the numbers show,
the crater of Series I is already at about its maximum
height in No. 4, i.e. about seven-thousandths
of a second after first contact. In this time the
fall due to gravity would be only about 1/100 of an
inch. Thus if gravity had not acted the crater
would only have risen about 1/100 of an inch higher.
The same reasoning applies to the rise of the central
column, but here the curvature at the summit
is much less sharp. The numbers show that the
column reaches its maximum height in about 5/100
of a second after its start in No. 10, and in this
time the fall due to gravity is about half an inch,
so that gravity has reduced the height by this
amount.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span></p>
</div>

<p>The second principle which I will now mention
enables us to explain the occurrence of the jets and
rays at the edge of the crater and their splitting into
drops.</p>

<p>It was shown in 1873 by the blind Belgian
philosopher, Plateau,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> that a cylinder of liquid is not
a figure of stable equilibrium if its length exceeds
about 3-1/7 times its diameter. Thus a long cylindrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[pg 37]</a></span>
rod of liquid, such as Fig. 11, if it could be obtained
and left for a moment to itself, would at once topple
into a row of sensibly equal, equidistant drops, the
number of which is expressed by a very simple law,
viz. that for every 3-1/7 times the diameter there is a
drop, or that the distance between the centres of the
drops is equal to the circumference of the cylinder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="position: relative; width: 500px;">
    <img src="images/fig-11.png"
    width="400" height="52" alt="" title="" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11</span></p>
</div>

<p>The cause of this instability is the action of the
same skin-tension that we have already spoken of.
Calculation shows, and Plateau was able to confirm
the calculation by experiment, that if through chance
agitations lobes are formed at a nearer distance apart
than 3-1/7 times the radius, with hollows between as in
the accompanying Fig. 12, then the curvatures will be
such as to make the skin-tension push the protuberances
back and pull the hollows out. But if the protuberances
occur at any greater distances apart than
the length of the perimeter, then the sharper curvature
of the narrower parts will drive the liquid there
into the parts already wider, thus any such an initial
accidental inequality of diameter will go on increasing,
or the whole will topple into drops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="position: relative; width: 500px;">
    <img src="images/fig-12.png"
    width="400" height="72" alt="" title="" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[pg 38]</a></span>
At the last moment the drops are joined by narrow
necks of liquid (Fig. 13), which themselves split up
into secondary droplets (Fig. 14).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="position: relative; width: 500px;">
    <img src="images/fig-13.png"
    width="400" height="75" alt="" title="" />

    width="400" height="81" alt="" title="" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14</span></p>
</div>

<p>What we have said of a straight liquid cylinder
applies also to an annulus of liquid made by bending
such a cylinder into a ring. This also will spontaneously
segment or topple into drops according to
the same law.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Now the edge of the crater is practically
such a ring, and it topples into a more or less
regular set of protuberances, the liquid being driven
from the parts between into the protuberances.</p>

<p>Now while the crater is rising the liquid is flowing
up from below towards the rim, and the spontaneous
segmentation of the rim means that channels of easier
flow are created, whereby the liquid is driven into the
protuberances, which thus become a series of jets.
These are the jets or arms which we see at the edge
of the crater. Examination with a lens of some of
the craters will show that the lines of easier flow
leading to a jet are often marked by streaks of
lamp-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[pg 39]</a></span>black
in Series I, or by streaks of milk in Series II.
This explanation of the formation of the jets applies also
to a similar phenomenon on a much larger scale, with
which the reader will be already familiar. If he has
ever watched on a still day, on a straight, slightly
shelving sandy shore, the waves that have just impetus
enough to curl over and break, he will have noticed
that up to a certain moment the wave presents a long,
smooth, horizontal cylindrical edge (see Fig. 15<i>a</i>) from
which, at a given instant, are shot out an immense
array of little jets which speedily break into foam,
and at the same moment the back of the wave,
hitherto smooth, is seen to be furrowed or combed
(see Fig. 15<i>b</i>). The jets are due to the segmentation of
the cylindrical rim according to Plateau's law, and the
ridges between the furrows mark the lines of easier
flow determined by the position of the jets.</p>

<p>The tendency of the central column of Series I to
separate into two parts is only another illustration of
the same instability of a liquid cylinder. The column,
however, is much thicker than the jets, and its surface
is therefore less sharply curved, and consequently the
inward pressure of the stretched curved surface is
relatively slight and the segmentation proceeds only
slowly. Since this segmentation must originate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[pg 40]</a></span>
some accidental tremor, we see how it is that the
summit of the column may succeed in separating off
on some occasions and not on others. As a matter of
fact, the height of fall for this particular splash was
purposely selected, so that the column thrown up
should <i>just</i> not succeed in dividing in order that the
formation of the subsequent ripples might not be disturbed
by the falling in of the drops split off. But, as
the reader will have perceived, the margin allowed
was not quite sufficient.</p>

<p>The two principles that I have now explained, viz.
the principle of the skin-tension, and the principle of
the instability and spontaneous segmentation of a
liquid cylinder, jet, or annulus, will go far to explain
much that we shall see in any splash, but it is well
that the reader should realize how much has been left
unexplained. Why, for example, should the crater
rise so suddenly and vertically immediately round the
drop as it enters? Why should the drop spread itself
out as a lining over the inside of the crater, turning
itself inside out, as it were, and making an inverted
umbrella of itself? Why when the crater subsides
should it flow inwards rather than outwards, so as to
throw up such a remarkable central column?</p>

<p>These questions, which demand that we should
trace the motion of every particle of the water back
to the original impulse given by the impact of the
drop, are much more difficult to answer, and can only
be satisfactorily dealt with by a complicated mathematical
analysis. Something, however, in the way of
a general explanation will be given in a later chapter.</p>

<h3>THE SPLASH CONTINUED</h3>

<p>I have stated that the addition of the milk to
the water made but little difference in the
character of the resulting splash. It does, however,
make certain differences in detail, as will be gathered
from an examination of the next Series I<i>a</i>, which
shows the effect of letting the water-drop fall from the
same height into water instead of into milk. Such
a splash is difficult to photograph unless the illumination
is from behind. As shown in this way, the early
figures of the crater might be unintelligible to the
reader had he not already studied the same crater
lighted up from the side. Sometimes, though the
front of the crater is hardly visible directly, yet every
lobe on it can be clearly traced in the inverted image
seen by reflection.</p>

<p>The most noticeable difference between the two
splashes is perhaps the very much greater number of
ripples seen with the splash in pure water. This is
partly because, with the illumination behind, such
ripples are more easily visible, but arises chiefly from
the fact that ripples are not so readily propagated
over the surface of milk on account both of its smaller
surface-tension and its greater viscosity. The first
appearance of outward-spreading ripples is in No. 6,
just round the subsiding crater.</p>

Since the origination of these ripples is an interesting
phenomenon from a physical point of view, as
throwing light on the dispersion of waves travelling
with different velocities, special precautions were taken
to secure the most favourable conditions, and in order
to clean the surface after the arrival of each drop,
which inevitably brings down a little adherent lamp-black,
a continuous slow stream of fresh water was
maintained which swept the contaminated surface-liquid
away over the edge of the vessel.</p>

<p>The effect of this precaution is seen by a comparison
of the photographs No. 11 and No. 11<i>a</i>. In the
first the surface was kept quite clean in the way
described; in the second it had only been cleaned by
skimming it with a fine wire-gauze dish.</p>

<p>The beginning of the descent of the first central
column seems to be marked by the appearance of
a slight depression round its base, which has just not
begun in No. 11<i>a</i>, and has just begun in No. 11, and
goes on increasing in Figs. 12 and 13.</p>

The same feature marks the beginning of the
descent of the secondary central column, which is
still rising in Fig. 17, is just poised in Fig. 18, and
thence onwards shows a gradually increasing central
depression. These last four figures carry us to a
rather later stage than was reached in Series I.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that in this Series the water-drop
used was of smaller diameter than that of Series I,
weighing &middot;13 grams as against &middot;2 grams. By employing
the smaller drop, we diminish irregularities due to
oscillations of form set up on release, for the smaller
drop is more spherical when lying on the dropping
cup than the larger; a few photographs taken for
comparison with the full-sized drop showed, however,
extremely little difference in the splashes at this height
of fall.</p>

<h3>HIGHER FALLS&mdash;BUBBLE-BUILDING</h3>


<p>It might well be expected that the effect of increasing
the height of fall of our drop to 100 cm.
would be simply to emphasize the phenomena already
observed, and to obtain a higher crater and a taller
rebounding column. Such an expectation would be
mistaken. A new phenomenon makes its appearance.
The crater does indeed rise to a greater height, but
its mouth closes so as to form a bubble on the surface
of the liquid. If the height be not too great the
closing is either incomplete or at any rate only temporary,
and the bubble reopens at the top to make
way for the column which rises as before from the
base, but is now much thicker and hardly so high as
before.</p>

<p>In the Series II, which is now given, the drop was
of milk, 7&middot;36 mm. in diameter, and fell 100 cm. into
water.</p>

<p>Photographs 1 and 2&mdash;to which is added 2<i>a</i>, though
taken under slightly different conditions&mdash;show that
the drop on entering punches a sheer-walled hole, for
the fine line of light seen above the level of the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[pg 54]</a></span>
the drop in Figs. 2 and 2<i>a</i> marks the circular cliff-like
edge of the as yet undisturbed liquid. Up the vertical
sides of this circular pit the liquid of the drop is
streaming. This cliff is highest and perhaps clearest
in Fig. 2<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The closing of the mouth of the crater, which is
just beginning in Fig. 5, is to be explained as follows.
If the crater were a simple thin-walled cylinder of
liquid, it would contract under the influence of the
surface-tension just as does a soap-bubble, but not so
fast, since the walls have only a horizontal curvature.
If the wall is thinner above than below, then the
upper part will contract faster than the lower, through
there being less liquid to accelerate. Now the supply
of liquid is from below, and will thicken the lower
part of the walls first, and thus account for the faster
closing of the mouth. On the other hand, the uppermost
edge of the crater is the place where the checking
influence of the surface-tension on the upward flow is
first felt, with the result that the edge of the rim is
thickened by the influx from below, so that a more or
less regular rope-like annulus is formed round the
edge. Now calculation shows that such an annulus,
so long as its thickness is not more than 1&middot;61 times
the thickness of the wall below, will contract quicker
than the wall, and this will tend to close the crater,
somewhat as a bag would be closed by the contraction
of an elastic cord round the mouth. This rope-like
thickening of the edge is to be seen in Figs. 5 and 7,
and especially in Figs. 3 and 4 of Series III on <a href="#Page_63">page
63</a>.</p>

The photographs 9, 10, and 11 (obtained after
adding a little milk to the water in order to render
it more visible) were at first very puzzling. What
happens is that the bubble sometimes reopens very
soon (or perhaps does not quite close) as in Fig. 9,
and makes way for the column which rises from the
base exactly as in the previous series. This column
may be dimly seen through the walls of the bubble in
Fig. 9, and No. 10 shows the column alone, the bubble
having opened early and receded with great velocity,
a few drops round the base being all that is left of it.
Nos. 10<i>a</i> and 10<i>b</i> illustrate this reopening. In 10<i>a</i>
the milk-drop was allowed to fall again into quite
pure water, and the photograph shows very beautifully
the summit of the column, with the original milk-drop
at the top, emerging through the reopening mouth
of the bubble; and Fig. 10<i>b</i> shows the same at a very
slightly later stage when the bubble has completely
retreated.</p>

In Fig. 11 the bubble has been too firmly closed to
reopen, and the summit has been struck by the column
within. The next figure (No. 12) shows how in such
a case the emergent column becomes entangled in
the liquid of the bubble when it bursts. Under the
influence, however, of the surface-tension, which pushes
back the protuberances and pulls out the hollows,
regularity of form is soon regained. Thus Fig. 13
shows the emergent columns at a later stage after
such an encounter, already much more symmetrical;
and the subsequent photographs (for which a good
deal of milk was added for the sake of greater
visibility) show a column of uniformly sedate and
respectable rotundity, betraying no traces of any
youthful irregularities.</p>

Series III shows the effect of still further increasing
the height of fall of the water-drop (to 137 cm., or
about 4 ft. 6 in.), and at the same time doubling
its volume so that it now weighs &middot;4 gram. The crater
now closes in about 18/1000 of a second, and forms
a comparatively permanent bubble. The rope-like
thickening of the edge, already alluded to, is
well seen in Figs. 3 and 4. In its earlier stages
the bubble is thick-walled, rough, and furrowed, but
becomes smoother and thinner the longer it lasts, both
because the liquid drains down the sides and because
it becomes more uniformly distributed under the
equalizing influence of the surface-tension.</p>

Such a bubble may remain long closed, as in
Fig. 8, becoming every moment more delicate and
exquisite, or it may open at an even earlier stage,
as in Fig. 9.</p>

<p>There is a characteristic difference between the
arms of a closing and of an opening bubble. It will
be noticed that up to the moment of closing the arms
slope outwards. The upper portions have been projected
at an earlier stage when the mouth of the crater
was wider open and the flow was either actually outwards
or more nearly vertical; then as the mouth
contracts the arms are left behind in the upper parts.</p>

In an opening bubble, on the other hand, the arms
are at first vertical, and later have the very characteristic
inward slope of the last figure, which is also well
seen in Fig. 10<i>a</i> of the last series. Here the edge of
the opened bubble retreats outwards and downwards,
leaving the arms behind.</p>

<p>Such is the origin of the bubbles raised by the big
drops of a thunder shower on the surface of a pool.
The building of each fairy dome is accomplished in
less than two-hundredths of a second, and before one-tenth
of a second has elapsed the whole construction
may have vanished. One can almost regret that so
beautiful a process should have been so long unwatched.</p>

<p>To build these bubbles a large drop is essential.
With a drop weighing only 0&middot;4 of a gram, even though
it fall from a height of 177 cm., there is no bubble, and
the splash is almost exactly that of Series I<i>a</i>. The
exact time required for the closing of the bubble probably
depends a good deal on the phase of oscillation
of the drop at the moment of entry, and, as already
observed, a big drop, which lies very flat in the dropping
cup, is set vibrating more strongly on liberation
than a small one.</p>

<p>We shall see in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a> that the impact of a
rough solid sphere, if falling from a sufficient height,
produces a very exquisite bubble; in this case irregularities
due to oscillation are absent, and the closing
can be timed with greater precision.</p>

<h3>BELOW THE SURFACE<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></h3>


<p>Our investigation has so far been limited to
what we can see from above the surface of the
liquid; nor perhaps would it occur to any one acquainted
only with so much as we have yet examined
that it might be worth while to look below the general
level of the surface. The discovery, however, that
when the splash is made by a solid sphere very
remarkable phenomena, which will be described in
the next chapter, take place below the surface, led at
a much later date to a similar examination in the case
of a liquid drop.</p>

<p>A suitable arrangement of the apparatus in the
dark room is shown in the accompanying diagram
(Fig. 16).</p>

<p>The water into which the drop is to fall is placed in
a thin glass vessel AB, with parallel sides. (An inverted
clock-shade makes a very convenient vessel.)
The water fills the vessel to the brim, and is allowed
to overflow it in a steady stream, thus presenting
a surface which, being perpetually renewed, is maintained
perfectly clean. Close behind the vessel is
a plate P of finely roughened glass, on which the
light from the spark-gap F, in front of its concave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[pg 70]</a></span>
reflector M, is thrown by means of the condenser lens
L taken from an optical lantern. This provides a
very uniformly illuminated background against which
the splash is viewed by means of the camera C, whose
optic axis is horizontal, either a little below the level
of the liquid surface or at that level. By having it
just at the level of the surface we secure simultaneous
pictures of what is going on both above and below
the surface. There is, to be sure, a narrow band or
region of confusion stretching across the photographs
in which the images obtained by reflection, both
external and internal, overlap the direct images, and
it should also be mentioned that the two pictures will
not be quite in focus together, for the optical effect of
the water, through which the part below the surface is
viewed, is to bring the image forward.</p>

<p>The photographs of Series IV were obtained in this
way from the splash of a drop of water weighing
0&middot;176 grams falling 40 cm. into water. (The same
splash as that of Series I<i>a</i>.) The perfectly spherical
form presented by the cavity below the surface is very
remarkable. In the present case, this spherical cavity
when at its deepest, as in Fig. 5, would contain about
fifty of the original drops, and in other cases&mdash;e.g.
with a drop of 1/4 the volume, falling from 177 cm.&mdash;the
cavity would contain as many as 360 of the
original drops.</p>

<p>In Figs. 5, 6, and 7 the depth of the cavity is nearly
constant, but the diameter is steadily increasing. The
spherical form, however, is still maintained. The last
figure shows the central column just beginning to rise.</p>

There can be no doubt that the liquid of the original
drop is spread out in an excessively thin lining over the
interior of this sphere. The reader has seen for himself
part of the evidence in the streaks of milk that
are carried up the inner walls of the crater when a
milk-drop falls into water (Series II); in the streaks
of lamp-black that are carried there when the drop is
of milk, and it may here be mentioned that other
photographs that cannot be reproduced here have
enabled me to trace the gradual deformation of the
drop into this thin layer and show that it passes
through configurations like Figs. 17, 18, and 19.</p>

<p>It appears possible that the study of this remarkable
spherical excavation may afford a clue that will lead
to a solution of the very difficult hydro-dynamical
questions involved, and the matter is still being
investigated.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE TWO KINDS OF SPLASHES OF SOLID SPHERES</h3>


<p>In the present chapter will be described the splash
that follows the entry of a <i>solid</i> sphere falling
vertically into a liquid from a small height, and I
should like to persuade the reader, if possible before
he begins to read, or at any rate afterwards, to make
a very simple experiment. Let a few child's marbles
be taken&mdash;not glass "marbles," for these are seldom
round enough or smooth enough, but what are sold in
the toy-shops as "stone" marbles&mdash;and let one of
these be well rubbed and polished with a dry handkerchief,
and then dropped from a height of about
30 cm., or, say, 1 foot, into a deep bowl or basin of
water, the bottom of which may be conveniently protected
from breakage by a few folds of fine copper
gauze.</p>

<p>If the polishing has been good, and the surface of
the sphere has not been dimmed by subsequent
handling with hot or greasy fingers, it will be observed
that the splash is singularly insignificant, the sphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[pg 74]</a></span>
slipping noiselessly into the liquid with very little
disturbance of the surface.</p>

<p>But if the same sphere be fished out of the water,
and again let fall from the same height without being
first dried, or, better still, if another marble be taken,
which has been previously roughened with sand-paper,
the resulting splash is totally different. There is now
a noise of bubbles, which may be seen rising through
the liquid, and a tall jet is seen to be tossed into the
air.</p>


<p class="center">(1) THE SPLASH OF A ROUGH SPHERE.</p>

<p>To understand the cause of this really surprising
difference we must turn to the photographic record,
and we will take first the case of a rough sphere
falling into water to which milk has been added for
the sake of clearness in the photographs. The
diameter of the sphere was 1&middot;5 cm. (or 3/5 inch), and
the height of fall 15 cm., or just about 6 inches. The
sphere on each occasion was fished out, redried, and re-roughened
with sand- or emery-paper. Examination
of the first photographs of Series V shows that the
liquid, instead of flowing over and wetting the surface
of the sphere, is driven violently away, so that as far as
can be seen from above the upper portion is, at first at
any rate, unwetted by the liquid. The crater that is
subsequently formed is very similar to that which was
thrown by the liquid drop in Series I, the main difference
being that in the present-case the crater is
thinner in the wall and more regular. This greater
regularity is chiefly to be attributed to the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[pg 76]</a></span>
the solid sphere enters the liquid with a true spherical
form, and is not distorted by the oscillations and
tremors which disturb a falling drop. The gradual
thickening of the wall and the corresponding reduction
in the number of lobes as the subsidence proceeds
is beautifully shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10, the
last-mentioned figure being hardly distinguishable
from the corresponding Fig. 9 of Series I, <a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>.
This stage is in each case reached in about 58/1000
of a second.</p>

Now from the depths of the crater there rises
with surprising velocity the exquisite jet of Fig. 11,
which in obedience to the law of segmentation at
once splits up in its upper portion into little drops,
while at the same time it gathers volume from below,
and rises ultimately as a tall, graceful column to a
height which may be even greater than that from
which the sphere fell. This is the emergent jet which
one sees with the naked eye whenever a sufficiently
rough sphere is dropped from a small height into
water, but if we are to ascertain how this column
originates, we must follow the sphere below the surface
of the liquid. The arrangement already described
on <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a> enables this to be done. We let the sphere
fall into clear water contained in a narrow, flat-sided,
inverted clock-shade and illuminate this from behind
while the camera stands straight in front.</p>

In this manner were obtained the photographs of
Series VI, which require a little explanation. In the
first figure we see the sphere just entering the liquid.
The faint horizontal line shows the level of the surface.
Above this line we see the internally reflected
image of the part that has already entered, while
still higher in the figure may be discerned the
summit of the sphere itself. The slight lateral displacement
of the part below the surface is due to
refraction consequent on the camera having been set
with its optic axis not quite perpendicular to the
face of the vessel. In the subsequent figures it
will be observed that the sphere, as it descends,
drags with it the surface of the liquid in the form
of a gradually deepening pocket or bag, the upper
part of the sphere being for a long time quite unwetted
by the liquid.</p>

<p>The sides of this pocket or bag of air not being
quite smooth, give a somewhat distorted appearance
to the sphere within. Also, since the sides are sloping,
their reflected image in the level surface slopes in the
opposite direction and produces an angle where the
two meet. This angle marks very clearly the level of
the surface. Above the surface-line in Figs. 2 to 5
is seen the beaded lip of the crater which we have
already viewed from above, but this is somewhat out
of focus, for the camera had to be focused on the
sphere as seen under water, and the effect of the
water is to bring the sphere optically nearer. Hence
only the nearer part of the crater, i.e. the middle part
of the front edge, is distinctly shown.</p>

Coming now to Fig. 6, we perceive that the long
cylindrical hollow has begun to divide. In this spontaneous
division we have another illustration of the
law of instability which regulated the sub-division of
the jets and columns of earlier series. This law is the
same whether the cylinder be of air surrounded by
liquid or of liquid surrounded by air. Hitherto we
have only seen it operating in jets of liquid in air;
now we have a jet of air in a liquid.</p>

<p>The lower part of the long cylinder of air splits off
into a bubble just behind the sphere, and follows in
its wake to the bottom of the vessel, and is only
detached and rises to the surface when the sphere
strikes the bottom. Many years ago, through the
kindness of the curator of the Brighton Aquarium, I
was enabled to watch this bubble of air following in
the wake of the sphere to the bottom of the deepest
tank.</p>

<p>Figs. 7, 8, and 9 show the two parts gradually

Fig. 10 shows specially well the ripples on the
surface of the descending bubble. These undulations
sometimes become so accentuated that the upper part
of this descending bubble is detached, and then the
curious phenomenon may be seen of this detached
part still following the rest downwards through the
liquid with an unsteady, lurching motion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the upper half of the divided air-column
is seen in Fig. 9 to resemble a deep basin which
now rapidly fills up by the influx of liquid from all
sides. It is from the confluence of this inflowing
liquid into channels which necessarily narrow as the
centre is approached that the great velocity with
which the liquid spirts upwards is obtained. In Fig.
11 the jet is just discernible above the surface, and in
Fig. 13 it is well-established.</p>

On increasing the height of fall of a rough sphere
to 60 cm., we obtain a higher crater which closes and
forms a bubble, exactly as when we increased the
height of fall of a liquid drop. The process as
viewed from above the surface is shown in Series VII.
The first figure of this series shows very well how
completely the liquid is driven away from the surface
of the sphere the first moment of contact. The subsequent
crater and bubble are of exquisite delicacy.
This bubble, though it closes completely as in the last
figure, is doomed to almost immediate destruction.
For we see, on looking below the surface, that the
proceedings there are of the same kind as in the case
of the lower fall already described, and result in the
formation of an upward-directed jet.</p>

Thus the first three figures of Series VIII show
the last moments of a bubble which has burst, spontaneously,
and so has made way for the jet of Fig. 3.
(These are taken from a splash into petroleum with
24&middot;5 cm. fall.) But the last two figures, 4 and 5
(taken with a 32 cm. fall), show how a bubble which
might otherwise have been permanent, is stabbed by
the rising jet and destroyed. With water and 60 cm.
fall the jet appears sometimes to rise quite unimpeded,
and sometimes to be checked by the still closed bubble.</p>

<p>Before leaving the splash of a rough sphere, I desire
to call the reader's attention to another point.</p>

<p>Such figures as 7, 9, and 10 of Series V, <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, show
that the surface of the liquid beyond the walls of
the crater is still flat and undisturbed; yet we now
know from the corresponding Figs. 5, 6, and 7 of
Series VI, <a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>, that a large volume of liquid has been
displaced, much larger than the quantity required to
form the crater wall. The inference is that the level
of the surface has been slightly raised even at a great
distance from the place of the splash. Figs. 7, 8, and
9 of Series VI themselves confirm the impression of
the undisturbed flatness of the surface at even a small
distance from the splash.</p>


<p>(2) THE SPLASH OF A SMOOTH SPHERE.</p>

<p>The reader who has been sufficiently interested to
make for himself the simple experiment suggested
at the beginning of this chapter, will have already
realized that the splash of a smooth sphere is totally
different from that of a rough one. The photographs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[pg 90]</a></span>
of Series IX show that the difference is quite pronounced
from the first instant of contact. In this
series the sphere was of polished stone 3&middot;2 cm. in
diameter and fell 14 cm. The scale of magnification
is 3/4. The second figure shows that the liquid, instead
of being driven away from the surface as was
the case with a rough sphere, now rises up in a thin,
closely-fitting sheath which (see Fig. 3) completely
envelops the sphere even before its summit has
reached the water-level. Figs. 4 and 5 show the
comparatively insignificant column that remains to
mark the spot where the sphere has entered. Fig.
6 was the result of a lucky accident, which left the
sphere rough on the right-hand side, smooth on the
left. Nothing could show better than this photograph
the essential difference between the two
splashes.</p>

<p>Examination of either Series IX or Series X
shows that with the smooth sphere as with the rough
the amount of water lifted above the surface in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[pg 92]</a></span>
immediate neighbourhood of the splash is much less
than the whole volume displaced, so that we are
again driven to the conclusion that the surface at
even a considerable distance must be bodily lifted
without its flatness being sensibly disturbed. This
conclusion was confirmed by a direct experiment.
The not very wide vessel of Fig. A was taken and
filled brimful with milk, and the lower edge of a
card millimetre scale was placed just in contact with
the liquid surface at one side. The reader should
notice that the liquid is not quite up to the level of
the spout on the right-hand side of this figure. Then
the sphere was dropped in and the photograph of
Fig. B was taken when the sphere was about two-thirds
immersed. The rise at the edge of the scale
is about 3 millimetres, and there is an apparently
equal rise at the spout, where, however, the surface
appears quite flat.</p>

<p>It may here be observed that whether the sphere
be rough or smooth, its size makes little or no difference
in the character of the splash, within a range of
diameter from 12 to 32 millimetres&mdash;i.e. from about
1/2 inch to about 1-1/3 inches. No doubt with a very
large sphere, taking a long time to enter, the splash
would be controlled more by gravity than by surface-tension,
but so long as the sphere is within the limits
mentioned this is not the case unless the height of
fall be made very small indeed.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSITION FROM THE SMOOTH OR
"SHEATH" SPLASH TO THE ROUGH OR"BASKET" SPLASH</h3>


<p class="center">THE INFLUENCE OF VELOCITY.</p>

<p>If we gradually increase the velocity with which a
well-polished sphere enters the liquid we find that
there is a gradual transition from the silent "smooth"
or "sheath" splash taking down no air and giving
rise to only an insignificant column, to the noisy,
"rough," "basket" splash taking down much air
and throwing up a tall and conspicuous jet. Thus
in the fourth figure of Series XI, in which the height
of fall has been increased from 15 to 60 cm. (i.e. from
6 inches to 2 feet), the sphere being of polished ivory,
we see that the enveloping sheath has in many places
broken away from the surface before the summit
has been covered. It is well known that a sphere
moving through a liquid pushes away the liquid in
front of it, which flowing round closes in at the back
of the sphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[pg 96]</a></span>
Although the surface round the column of Fig. 6 is
still very flat, the liquid just below it must be streaming
inwards,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> as is indicated by the radial stri&aelig;. To
the meeting of these converging streams we must
attribute the large access of liquid that is forced up
into the column, whose subsequent toppling into drops
is accompanied by the curious, characteristic, lop-sided
curvature of the later figures.</p>

Series XII shows how even with a very highly
polished metal sphere falling into water from the still
greater height of 100 cm. the characteristic sheath
of the "smooth" splash is no longer so closely fitting
even at an early stage, but is beginning to resemble
the earlier stages of the basket-shaped crater of the
"rough" splash; yet no air was taken down
at this height.</p>

<p>The transition was also watched by
means of photographs taken below the
water-line.</p>

<p>It may be well here to guard the reader
against a possible misconception. The
curved outline of the liquid in these photographs does
not represent the path followed by the particles.
Each particle must have travelled in a nearly straight
line from the moment it left the surface of the sphere,
and must still be moving upwards and outwards.
Gravity has not had time to produce any sensible
displacement. This applies also to the curved outlines
in many other early figures.</p>


<p class="center">INFLUENCE OF THE CONDITION OF THE SURFACE.</p>

<p>By very careful rubbing of such a polished, steel
sphere, it was found possible to increase the height of
fall to 162&middot;5 cm. (well over 5 feet) and yet to secure
a perfectly "airless," "smooth" splash. But the
equilibrium of the splash, if I may use the phrase, is,
at this high velocity of entry (564 cm. per sec., or about
18 feet per sec.), very unstable, and was found to depend
on minute differences in the condition of the surface.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[pg 100]</a></span>
How minute this difference may be, which yet makes
the whole difference in the character of the splash, may
be gathered from the following extract from the
original paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A polished steel sphere 15&middot;9 cm. in diameter was
found (by naked-eye observation) to give an airless
splash when falling into water from a height of 132&middot;5
cm.; at 137&middot;5 cm., there was much air taken down.
This observation at 137&middot;5 cm. was repeated three
times, observer C. doing the polishing. Then observer
W. polished, and the splash was first <i>nearly</i> airless
and then <i>quite</i> airless. Then, by persevering in
the rubbing, the height of fall was gradually raised
to 162&middot;5 cm., and a perfectly airless splash was
secured, and even at 172&middot;5 cm. the record was 'very
little air indeed.'</p>

<p>"Again, a polished marble sphere 2&middot;57 cm. in diameter
falling into water from a height of 112 cm. was found
to take down 'much air' when rubbed with a certain
clean handkerchief A, and 'none at all, or only very
little,' when rubbed with clean handkerchief B. This
result was confirmed four times with B and five with
A. These handkerchiefs were subsequently examined
under the microscope, but were found to be extremely
similar, and the cause of the difference remained for
the time beyond conjecture.</p>

<p>"On another occasion, of two similar nickel-plated
steel spheres, each 19 millimetres in diameter, and
each treated in exactly the same way, falling 22
cm. into paraffin oil, one would always take down
much air and the other little or none, and again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[pg 101]</a></span>
microscopic examination showed only a very slight
difference in the surfaces."</p>

<p>By wetting the surface of a smooth sphere we can
always convert a smooth or "sheath" splash into
a rough or "basket" splash. Thus when the ivory
sphere (which when dry and well-polished gave, with
a fall of 60 cm., the splash of Series XI, <a href="#Page_97">p. 97</a>), was
allowed to fall <i>wet</i> into the liquid, all other circumstances
remaining the same, the splash of Series XIII, <a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>,
was obtained, which is entirely different from the first.
The wetting was effected by dipping the sphere into
the bowl of milky water into which it was to fall, and
then shaking off as much as possible of the adherent
liquid, but in all cases the splash quickly became
unsymmetrical, probably through the liquid, during
the fall, drifting to one side of the sphere.</p>


<p>INFLUENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE LIQUID.</p>

<p>The nature of the liquid employed has a great influence
in determining whether at a given height the
splash shall be "rough" or "smooth."</p>

<p>Thus with paraffin oil the maximum height that
could be reached with an airless splash with highly
polished nickel-plated spheres, well rubbed on a selvyt
cloth, was found to be only 24&middot;7 cm. (about 10 inches),
but, with water, a fall of 160 cm. (over 5 feet) could be
reached. The paraffin oil used in these experiments
had, at a temperature of 12&deg;&middot;5 centigrade, a specific
gravity &middot;840 and a surface-tension about &middot;39 of that of
water. Since only a small increase of height was required
with this liquid to make a smooth sphere give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[pg 102]</a></span>
the same splash as a rough one, this liquid was found
much more convenient than water in investigating the
transition.</p>

<p>When water is made more viscid by the gradual addition
of glycerine,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
the surface-tension and the specific
gravity are but little altered though the viscosity is
steadily and sensibly increased. An admixture of two
parts of glycerine to fifty-one of water produced no
perceptible change in the splashes observed. When
the glycerine was increased to six volumes in fifty-one
of water, though this made the viscosity half as great
again, the change was noticeable but still slight, the
chief difference being, with a smooth sphere, the
greater salience of the ribs or flutings in some of
the earlier stages of the glycerine splash, and the
much greater reluctance of the subsequent jets to
topple into droplets. This latter feature is well seen
in the first figure on <a href="#Page_105">page 105</a>, showing the entry
of a smooth sphere of polished serpentine stone into
this glycerine mixture from a height of 50 cm.</p>

<p>With pure glycerine, which is much more viscous,
the splash of the same polished serpentine sphere falling
from 75 cm. (about 2-1/2 feet), is shown in Series XIV.
In the original photographs the radial furrows on the
right-hand side of Fig. 2 are very pronounced, and
even in Fig. 1 the fluting of the film is seen to be
already well developed on the left-hand side; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[pg 104]</a></span>
these details have proved rather too delicate for reproduction
in the plate. Two photographs taken of
stage 2 had each of them an isolated jet, owing probably
to the fact that when working with so sticky a liquid
it was difficult to avoid contaminating the cloth on
which the sphere was each time repolished after washing
in water, with the result that the spheres behaved
as if locally rough. The relatively great length and
height of this jet brings out well the part played by
viscosity, both in delaying segmentation into droplets
and also in hindering the flow of the rest of the
liquid sheath which has remained in contact with the
sphere.</p>

from the same height of 75 cm., except for an
occasional jet that may escape as in Fig. 4 of Series
XV, the proceedings are uneventful, as a glance at
the series will show. With the same height of fall
into water we should have had an exquisite crater
fringed with a multitude of fine jets, and ultimately
closing to form a bubble. We thus see how little play
is given to the action of the surface-tension in a very
viscous liquid.</p>

<p class="center">THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE.</p>

<p>It was found that if a polished sphere was heated
in boiling water, quickly rubbed dry, and let fall while
still hot, a very marked difference was produced.
With the sphere hot, the height of fall can be much
increased before the splash becomes "rough." Thus
with paraffin oil, the height with a nickel-plated
sphere rose from 22&middot;2 cm. to 29&middot;3 cm., and with water
from 157 cm. to 234 cm.</p>


<p class="center">THE REMARKABLE INFLUENCE OF A FLAME HELD NEAR
THE LIQUID, AND TRAVERSED BY THE SPHERE IN
ITS FALL.</p>

<p>In our search for the explanation of the difference
between the rough and the smooth splash, it occurred
to us to let the smooth sphere drop through a flame
held near the liquid, and the result was very remarkable.
With paraffin oil (and the sphere hot) the airless
height now rose from 29&middot;3 cm. to 45&middot;3 cm., and
with water and a cold sphere, it rose from 157 cm. to
over 258 cm., which was the greatest height that the
laboratory would permit. Either the luminous flame
of a bat's-wing burner or the flame of a Bunsen
burner held nearly horizontal produces the effect,
provided the flame is held near enough to the surface
of the liquid, and it is a very striking experiment to
let the polished sphere fall several times from a height
which gives a large volume of bubbles rising with
much noise to the surface, and then to let it fall
through the flame, and to observe the complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[pg 107]</a></span>
change in the phenomenon. On a sphere already
roughened the flame has no observable effect.</p>


<p class="center">THE SUPPOSITION OF ELECTRIFICATION TESTED AND
REJECTED.</p>

<p>The behaviour with a flame led at first to the
supposition that we had to deal with an electrical
phenomenon, for a flame would certainly discharge
completely any electrified sphere passing through it,
and it appeared reasonable to suppose that the sphere
might become electrified by friction with the air
through which it fell.</p>

<p>It required a long series of experiments, into the
details of which I need not now ask my readers to
enter, to prove that this tempting explanation was
untenable, and that there was no reason to believe
that electrification had anything to do with the matter.</p>


<p class="center">EXPERIMENTS IN VACUO.</p>

<p>It remained to examine what part was played by
the air in the whole transaction. This could only be
settled by removing the air and letting the spheres,
whether rough or smooth, fall through a vacuum into
the liquid, or rather through a space occupied only by
the vapour of the liquid in use.</p>

<p>Instantaneous photographs obtained under these
conditions showed that the presence of the air has
no material influence on the early course of the
splash, and that a sphere which gives a "smooth"
splash in air will give a "smooth" splash in vacuo,
while if the splash is "rough" in air, it will also be
"rough" in vacuo.</p>

<h3>THE EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SPLASHES</h3>


<p>I have some hope that, by the enumeration of
the many surprising and puzzling facts mentioned
in the last chapter, I may have succeeded in producing
in the mind of my reader some sympathy with
the state of perplexity of Mr. Cole and myself when,
after four years of experimenting, we found ourselves
still unable to answer the question, "Why does the
rough sphere make one kind of splash, the smooth
sphere another kind?"</p>

<p>By reflecting, however, on all the facts at our
disposal, we were at last led to what seems to be an
entirely satisfactory explanation, and one moreover
which we were able to test by further experiment.</p>

<p>This explanation may be stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>When a sphere, either rough or smooth, first strikes
the liquid, there is an impulsive pressure between the
two, and the column of liquid lying vertically below
the elementary area of first contact is compressed.
For very rapid displacements the liquid on account
of its viscosity behaves like a solid. In the case of
a solid rod we know that the head would be somewhat
flattened out by a similar blow, and a wave of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[pg 109]</a></span>
compression would travel down it; to this flattening
or broadening out of the head of the column corresponds
the great outward radial velocity, tangential to
the surface, initiated in the liquid, of which we have
abundant evidence in many of the photographs. (See
pp. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>, <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, and <a href="#Page_99">99</a>.)</p>

<p>Into this outward-flowing sheath the sphere descends,
and since each successive zone of surface which enters
is more nearly parallel to the direction of motion of
the sphere, the displacement of liquid is most rapid
at the lowest point, from the neighbourhood of which
fresh liquid is supplied to flow along the surface.
Whether the rising sheath shall leave the surface of
the sphere, or shall follow it, depends upon the
efficiency of the adhesion to the sphere. If the
sphere is smooth and clean, the molecular forces of
cohesion will guide the nearest layers of the advancing
edge of the sheath, and will thus cause the initial
flow to be along the surface of the sphere.</p>

<p>To pull any portion of the advancing liquid out of
its rectilinear path the sphere must have rigidity. If
the advancing liquid meets loosely attached particles,
e.g. of dust, these will constitute places of departure
from the surface of the sphere; the dust will be
swept away by the momentum of the liquid which,
being no longer in contact with the sphere, perseveres
in its rectilinear motion. If the dust particles are few
and far between, the cohesion of the neighbouring
liquid will bring back the deserting parts, but if the
places of departure are many, then the momentum of
the deserters will prevail. Thus at every instant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[pg 110]</a></span>
there is a struggle between the momentum of the
advancing edge of the sheath and the cohesion of
the sphere; the greater the height of fall the
greater will be the momentum of the rising liquid,
and the less likely is the cohesion to prevail, and the
presence or absence of dust particles may determine
the issue of the struggle.</p>

<p>Roughness of the surface will be equally efficient in causing the liquid
to leave the sphere. For the momentum will readily carry the liquid past
the mouth of any cavities (see Fig. 20), into which it can only enter
with a very sharp curvature of its path. It is to be observed that the
surface-tension of the air-liquid surface of the sheath will act at all
times in favour of the cohesion of the sphere, and even if the film has
left the sphere the surface-tension will tend to make it close in again,
but we should not be right in attributing much importance to this
capillary pressure which, with finite curvatures, is a force of a lower
order of magnitude than the cohesion, and, as the photographs now to be
shown will clearly show, is incompetent to produce the effects observed.</p>

    width="400" height="200" alt="" title="" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20</span></p>
</div>

<p>Having arrived at this general explanation, we
proceeded to test it.</p>


<p class="center">EXPERIMENTS ON THE INFLUENCE OF DUST.</p>

<p>In the first place, to test the influence of dust, the
experiment was made of deliberately dusting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[pg 111]</a></span>
surface of the sphere. For this purpose a highly
polished nickelled sphere was held in a pair of crucible
tongs by an electrified person standing on an insulating
stool, and by him presented to any dusty
object that stood or could be brought within reach.
Particles of dust soon settled on the electrified sphere,
which was then carefully placed on the dropping ring
with the dusty side lowest. The liquid used was
paraffin oil, and the height of fall was 31&middot;7 cm.,
at which this sphere when not dusted gave always
a quite airless splash. When dusted an enormous
bubble of air was carried down on each occasion.
Although the sphere when laid on the dropping ring
must have completely lost the electrical charge, yet
it seemed worth while to go through the same
electrifying process without dusting. The result
showed that no change was produced. In order to
see how far the influence of dust would go, the
height of fall was now reduced, and it was found
that with sphere (1) a fall of 17&middot;1 cm. gave a
perfectly rough splash when the surface was visibly
dimmed with fine dust, and with a second similar
sphere a fall of 16&middot;7 cm. availed. If the surface was
only slightly dusty, then at these low heights the
splash remained "smooth."</p>

<p>It then occurred to us to try the effect of partial or
local dusting, for we had already found by experimenting
with a marked sphere that the method of
dropping did not impart any appreciable rotation to
the sphere, which reached the liquid in the attitude
with which it started from the dropping ring.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[pg 112]</a></span>
Accordingly, after dusting the sphere in the manner
already described, the dust was carefully rubbed away
from all but certain parts whose position was recorded.
The experiments were very successful, and
the results are shown on <a href="#Page_113">page 113</a>. The liquid used
was water, and the sphere was of polished serpentine,
2&middot;57 centim. in diameter, falling 14 centim.</p>

<p>In Fig. 1 of Series XVI the sphere was dusted
on the <i>right-hand side</i>, and a "sound of splash"
was recorded. On the left side we see that there
is no disturbance of the "smooth splash"; on the
right is a "pocket" of air such as was obtained by
accident in Series IX, Fig. 6 (see <a href="#Page_91">p. 91</a>). The
point of departure at which the liquid left the sphere
is well marked, and a tangent from this point passes
through the outermost conspicuous droplets that must
have been projected from it.</p>

<p>In Fig. 2 the sphere was dusted <i>at the top and on
the right-hand side, but not much more than half-way
down</i>, and the configuration corresponds entirely to
the facts. Here again a tangent from the well-marked
drops on the right-hand side leads very nearly to the
place of departure from the surface of the sphere.</p>

<p>In Fig. 3 the sphere was dusted near the bottom
only. The appearance on the left-hand side seems to
show that the liquid has, after leaving the sphere,
again been brought within reach. This recovery at
an early stage is explained by reference to photographs
of Series VI (<a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>) of the splash of a rough
sphere, which show that even the rough sphere is
soon wetted for some distance up the sides, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[pg 114]</a></span>
gradual passage of the sphere into the divergently
flowing cone of liquid which surrounds the lower part.
When the liquid again touches a polished part the
film will be again guided up it in the manner already
explained.</p>

<p>We observe that in Figs. 1 and 2 (as also in Fig. 6
of <a href="#Page_91">page 91</a>) the continuous film or shell of liquid
no longer reaches the outermost droplets that once
have been at its edge. It must evidently have been
pulled in by its own surface-tension, which of course
will cease to exercise any inward pull on a drop that
has once separated.</p>

<p>The influence of dust, thus incontestably proved,
seems also to afford a satisfactory explanation of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(1) The effect of a flame.</p>
<p>(2) The effect of heating.</p>
<p>(3) The variable and uncertain effects of electrification.</p>
</div>

<p>For, (1), we may suppose that the flame burns off
minute particles of dust; (2), we know from Aitken's
experiments<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> that dust from the atmosphere will not
settle on a surface hotter than the air; (3) an electrified
sphere descending through the air would attract dust
to its surface unless it happened, as well might happen,
that the air round about it, with its contained dust,
had become itself similarly charged through the working
of the electrical machine.</p>

<p>In further confirmation of our view that the leading
clue to the explanation of the motion is the
struggle between the adhesion of the rigid sphere and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[pg 115]</a></span>
the tangential momentum of the liquid, we may cite
the following points:&mdash;</p>

<p>A <i>liquid</i> sphere makes a "rough" splash, and the
photographs obtained show that the lower part of the
in-falling drop is swept away by the tangential flow,
while the upper part is still undistorted. Here we
have cohesion but no rigidity.</p>

<p>Also we find that the "rough" splash is obtained
by any process which gives a non-rigid surface to the
sphere. Thus the splash made by a marble freshly
roughened by sand-papering, or by grinding between
two files and let fall from the very small height of
7&middot;5 cm., can be practically controlled by attending to
the condition of the surface. If the surface is quite
dry and still covered with the fine powder resulting
from the process of roughening, the splash is "rough,"
and a great bubble of air is taken down. But if this
coat of powder, which has neither cohesion nor shearing
strength, be removed by rubbing, the splash (under
this low velocity) is "smooth." Again, a marble
freshly sand-papered and covered with the resulting
powder, if let fall from 12 or 15 cm., gives a rough
splash. The same marble picked out of the liquid
and very quickly dropped in again from the same
height, will give again a rough splash. Here the
liquid film is thick and "shearable." But if the same
sphere be allowed to drain or be lightly wiped, the
splash will be smooth. We may conjecture that in
this case enough fluid is left to fill up the interstices,
but that the coat is not thick enough to shear easily.
If, however, the sphere be thoroughly dried, the splash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[pg 116]</a></span>
becomes "rough" again. This gives us the explanation
of the facts already recorded in respect of the
splash of a wet sphere. This splash was always
irregular; the liquid drifted to one side where it would
shear, while it disappeared from the other or became
there too thin to shear, though sufficient to fill up
crevices.</p>


<p>EXPLANATION OF THE RIBS OR FLUTINGS IN THE
SPLASH OF A SMOOTH SPHERE.</p>

<p>The fact thus established experimentally, that the
surface of a smooth sphere must be rigid if the film
is to envelop it closely, suggests also a satisfactory
explanation of the flutings. For we know from other
researches on the motion of liquids,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
that a layer of
liquid actually in contact with a solid can have no
motion relative to the solid, but must move with it.
Thus in the film or sheath which rises over and
envelops the sphere, the layer of liquid next to the
solid must be moving downwards with it, while the
outermost layers at least are moving upwards; thus
there must be a strong viscous shear in the film impeding
its rise. If by any fortuitous oscillation a
radial rib arises, this will be a channel in which the
liquid, being farther from the surface, will be less
affected by the viscous drag; it will therefore be a
channel of more rapid flow and diminished pressure,
into which, therefore, the neighbouring liquid will be
forced from either side. Thus a rib once formed is
in stable equilibrium, and will correspond to a jet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[pg 117]</a></span>
the edge of the rim. This explains the persistence
of the ribs when once established, and we may attribute
their regular distribution to the fact that they
first originate in the spontaneous segmentation of the
annular rim at the edge of the advancing sheath.
This explanation quite accords with the appearance of
such figures as Fig. 6 of <a href="#Page_91">page 91</a> and Figs. 1 and 2
of <a href="#Page_113">page 113</a>, in which, firstly, we see that the flutings
are absent from that part of the sheath which has left
the sphere, and, secondly, we see how much higher in
every case the continuous film has risen in that part
which has left the sphere than in the part which has
clung to it, and has been hindered by the viscous
drag. Especially is this the case in Fig. 2, Series XIV
(<a href="#Page_105">p. 105</a>), where the liquid was pure glycerine. The
effect of the viscous drag is, in fact, most marked in
the most viscous liquid, and it is also in the viscous
liquid that the ribs are most strongly marked.</p>


<p>INFLUENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE LIQUID EXPLAINED.</p>

<p>Finally, in confirmation of our explanation, we have
the fact that with a liquid of small density and surface-tension,
such as paraffin oil, a much smaller velocity
of impact with a highly polished sphere suffices to give
a "rough" splash than with water, a liquid of greater
density and surface-tension, the reason being without
doubt that the tangential velocity given by the impact
is greater with the lighter liquid, as, indeed, is proved
to be the case by the greater height to which the surrounding
sheath is thrown up. The surface-tension
also being smaller, the less is the abatement of velocity
on account of work done in extending the surface.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>We have now reached the end of the story, as
far at least as I am able to tell it. But there
is certainly more to be found out. No one has yet
examined what happens when a rough sphere enters
a liquid with a very high velocity. That the motion
set up must differ from that at a low velocity is
apparent to any one who has thrown stones from
a low bridge into deep water below. The stone
that is thrown with a great velocity makes neither
quite the same sound nor the same kind of splash as
a slow-falling stone, and though in the light of our
present knowledge we may conjecture the kind of
difference to be expected, yet experience has taught
me that the subject is so full of unexpected turns that
it is better to wait for the photographic record than
to speculate without it.</p>

<p>It would be an immense convenience, as was suggested
in the first chapter, if we could use a kinematograph
and watch such a splash in broad daylight,
without the troublesome necessity of providing darkness
and an electric spark. But the difficulties of
contriving an exposure of the whole lens short enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[pg 119]</a></span>
to prevent blurring, either from the motion of the
object, or from that of the rapidly-shifting sensitive
film, are very great, and any one who may be able to
overcome them satisfactorily, will find a multitude of
applications awaiting his invention.</p>

<p>But even were the photographic record complete,
what does it amount to? All that we have done has
been merely to follow the rapid changes of form that
take place in the bounding surface of the liquid. The
interior particles of the liquid itself have remained
invisible to us. But it is precisely the motion of these
particles that the student of hydrodynamics desires to
be able to trace. His study is so difficult that even in
the apparently simple case of the gently-undulating
surface of deep water, the reasoning necessary to discover
the real path of any particle can at present only
be followed by the highly-trained mathematician. In
other and more complicated cases such as are exemplified
by the sudden disturbances that we have studied,
any definite information that can be obtained, even as
to the motion of the surface, may afford a clue to the
solution of important questions; and I have been encouraged
to hope that the observations here recorded
may serve as a useful basis of experimental fact in a
confessedly difficult subject.</p>

<p>To take a single illustration of a possible application
in an unexpected quarter, I would invite the
attention of the reader to the two photographs in the
<a href="#frontis">frontispiece</a>, which exhibit the splash of a projectile
on striking the steel armour-plate of a battleship.
These are ordinary photographs taken after the plate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[pg 120]</a></span>
had been used as a target. They represent the side
on which the projectile has entered. In one picture
the projectile is still seen embedded in the plate.</p>

<p>No one looking at these photographs can fail to
be struck with the close resemblance to some of the
splashes that we have studied. There is the same
<i>slight</i> upheaval of the neighbouring surface, the same
crater, with the same curled lip, leading to the inference
that under the immense and suddenly applied
pressure, the steel has behaved like a liquid.</p>

<p>Such flow of metals under great pressure is familiar
enough to mechanical engineers, but what I desire to
suggest is, that from a study of the motions set up in
a liquid in an analogous case, it may be possible to
deduce information about the distribution of internal
stress, which may apply also to a solid, and may thus
lead to improvements in the construction of a plate
that is intended to resist penetration.</p>

<h3>(SUPPLEMENTARY)</h3>

<h3>A NEW PHENOMENON THAT APPEARS WITH
AN INCREASE IN THE VELOCITY OF ENTRY
OF A ROUGH SPHERE</h3>


<p>A slight delay in the passage of this book
through the press has enabled me to obtain
some of the missing information referred to in the
opening paragraph of the last chapter.</p>

<p>If any reader who may have been persuaded to try
for himself the simple experiment mentioned at the
beginning of Chapter VII, will extend his observations
by increasing the height of fall of the roughened
marble to 4 or 5 feet (say to 140 centim.), he will
find that while, as before, much air is still carried
down, there is nevertheless, now, no rebounding jet
projected high into the air, such as is invariably seen
with the lower fall of 2 feet (60 centim.), and he will
notice a curious "seething" appearance at the surface.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
Thinking that this appearance which the
naked eye detects must be due to an entanglement
of the rising jet with the bubble, which entanglement
was likely to produce confused motions that could not
be profitably studied, I had not till now been sufficiently
curious to examine what really happened.
But certain recent observations of the persistence
with which the seething motion again and again
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[pg 122]</a></span>curred
when a stone was dropped or thrown into a
river, led me to suspect that something required investigation.
I was, however, quite unprepared to find
the remarkable change of procedure that is revealed
by the following series of photographs (Series XVII),
in the taking of which I owe much to the kind
and skilful assistance of Dr. Bryan. The earlier
figures show the very rapid rise of the crater and its
closing as a bubble much before the entrapped column
of air divides. Before the division takes place, the
liquid now flowing in from all sides closes over the
upper end of the long air-tube, separates it from the
air outside, and <i>forms a downward jet which shoots
down the middle of the air-tube in pursuit of the
sphere</i>. The first formation of this jet is not easy to
observe, because the view is obscured by much splashing
and turbulent vortical motion resulting apparently
from the collision of the streams that converge from
all sides on the axis of the air-tube at its upper end.
Thus in Fig. 5 the jet is not yet well established, or at
least not easily discerned; but in Fig. 6 the turbulence
has cleared away from the upper part, and from this
stage onwards the jet is well seen in all the figures,
and it persists long after the segmentation of the air
column has taken place. The reader must not suppose
that this jet is a mere <i>falling</i> of the water under the
action of gravity, for the rapidity with which it advances
is far greater than could be accounted for in
this way; indeed, as the "times" show, the effect of
gravity during the establishment of the jet is insignificant.</p>

The segmentation of the air column appears to be
independent of the jet; but some photographs, such
as Fig. 7, show the jet striking the side and breaking
into the surrounding liquid with a great accompaniment
of "air-dust."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[pg 126]</a></span>
The reader will observe that after division of the
air-tube has taken place, say from Fig. 9 onwards,
the water entering the jet at the top and coming out
again at the bottom must circulate as in a vortex ring,
part of the core of which is filled with the air surrounding
the jet.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed that after the establishment
of the jet, there is a steady increase in the size of the
heap above the surface; but it is not easy in any
given photograph to say how much of this protuberance
is air and how much is water. An examination
of Figs. 7, 8, and 9 shows that the place of origin of
the jet is gradually lifted above the level of the free
surface.</p>

<p>That the jet we now see should be directed downwards
rather than upwards may, I think, be explained
in a general way as follows:&mdash;The great initial momentum
of the sphere causes it to continue in rapid motion
after the bubble has closed, thus the sphere acts as
a sort of piston, which by increasing the length of the
air-tube diminishes the pressure in it and so sucks in
the bubble, which is driven down by the greater
atmospheric pressure above. The converging horizontal
inflow near the mouth of the air-tube cannot, of
course, produce the downward-directed jet without
an equal and opposite generation of momentum upwards;
but this is now expended, not in producing
a similar upward jet, but in balancing the excess of
atmospheric pressure. The reaction, in fact, to the
projection of the jet downwards, is the force which
holds up and slowly raises the roof of the long air-shaft.</p>

When, as in the last figure of Series VI, <a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>, we
saw the upward-directed jet, then also there must have
been an equal and opposite generation of downward
momentum distributed in some way through the liquid
below the basin, of which, however, there could be no
visible sign. Hence we see that the present downward
jet is, in a sense, not a new phenomenon, but one
which, having existed unnoticed before, is now rendered
visible to us by reason of its being produced in
air instead of in water.</p>

<p>By means of a hole bored through the ceiling of
the dark room, the fall was then increased to 281
centim. (just over 9 feet). The very beautiful earlier
stages of the splash at this height are shown in
Series XVIII. Fig. 4 shows very well the internal
splashing at the top of the air-column which accompanies
the initiation of the jet. Some later photographs
taken at this height (not yet quite presentable)
show the jet passing right down the narrow neck of
air-tube and probably striking the top of the sphere,
the descent of which must thus be liable to a curious
irregularity.</p>

<p>A further increase of the height of fall to 686
centim. (22-1/2 feet) was found to produce but little
change in the phenomena.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
